Writing a Spring Boot controller that handles HTTP requests and returns JSON responses.
- Always use `@RestController` for the controller class.
- Use `@RequestMapping` to define the base path for the controller.
- Use `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, `@DeleteMapping`, `@PatchMapping`, and `@PutMapping` for specific HTTP methods.
- Use `@RequestParam` for query parameters.
- Use `@PathVariable` for path variables.
- Use `@RequestBody` for request bodies in POST and PUT requests.
- Adhere to RESTful principles for resource naming and HTTP methods.
- Use `ResponseEntity<T>` to return responses with appropriate HTTP status codes.
- Use `@Valid` for validating request bodies.
- Use `@ExceptionHandler` to handle exceptions and return appropriate error responses.
- Use `@CrossOrigin` to enable CORS if needed.
- Use the service layer to handle business logic.

API Documentation
- Use Springdoc OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) for API documentation.
